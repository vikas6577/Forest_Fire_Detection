Forest Fire Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks and ThingSpeak API

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can detect fires in real-time using a webcam or video footage. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and trained on a dataset of images containing both fire and non-fire scenarios.

The project includes the following components:

      A Python script that uses OpenCV to capture video frames and feed them into the trained CNN for fire detection.

      A dataset of annotated fire and non-fire images for training and evaluation.

      Preprocessing scripts for data augmentation and conversion to the appropriate format for training with Keras.

      A Jupyter notebook containing the code for model training and evaluation.

      The final model achieves a high accuracy in detecting fires in real-time video streams, making it a useful tool for early fire detection and prevention.
